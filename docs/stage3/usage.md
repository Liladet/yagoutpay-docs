# Stage 3: Usage

## YagoutPay Static and Dynamic Payment Methods: Usage

- This document provides a clear usage guide for integrating YagoutPay's dynamic payment method using the Python SDK, as implemented in the repository at [CLICK HERE](https://github.com/Liladet/yagoutpay-dynamic-payment-method).

- This section explains how to use the Python SDK for dynamic payment links .

# Dynamic Payment Link

1. Prepare the Payload

- Create a payload with required fields (as shown in dynamic_link_sdk.py):

```bash
dynamic_payload =
{
    "req_user_id": "yagou381",
    "me_id": "202508080001",
    "amount": "500",
    "customer_email": "test@example.com",
    "mobile_no": "0909260339",
    "expiry_date": "2025-10-23",
    "media_type": ["API"],
    "order_id": f"DYN_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M')}",
    "first_name": "YagoutPay",
    "last_name": "DynamicLink",
    "product": "Premium Subscription",
    "dial_code": "+251",
    "failure_url": "http://localhost:3000/failure",
    "success_url": "http://localhost:3000/success",
    "country": "ETH",
    "currency": "ETB"
}
```

2. Generate the Payment Link

- Use the YagoutPaySDK class to create a dynamic link:

```bash
from dynamic_link_sdk import YagoutPaySDK
sdk = YagoutPaySDK("202508080001", "IG3CNW5uNrUO2mU2htUOWb9rgXCF7XMAXmL63d7wNZo=")
response = sdk.create_dynamic_link(dynamic_payload)
print(response)  # Example: {"status": "success", "link": "<payment_url>"}
```

- The SDK:
- Validates required fields and expiry date (within 30 days).
- Encrypts the payload using AES-256-CBC.
- Sends a POST request to /sdk/paymentByLinkResponse.
- Decrypts the response and extracts the payment link.

3. Handle the Response

- If successful, the response contains a link field with the payment URL.
- If an error occurs, check the message field (e.g., "Missing required payload fields").
- Share the payment link with the customer (e.g., via email or redirect).

4. Process Callbacks

- Use ngrok to expose the server (ngrok http 3000) and update URLs in the payload.

# Additional Notes

- Encryption: dynamic methods use AES-256-CBC with a 32-byte key and static IV (0123456789abcdef), as implemented in encryption.py.

- API Endpoints:
- Dynamic: /sdk/paymentByLinkResponse

- Testing:
- Test with small amounts (e.g., 1.00 ETB).
- Disable SSL verification (verify=False) for local testing only; enable in production.

- Troubleshooting:
- Ensure MERCHANT_ID and MERCHANT_KEY are valid.
- Check payload fields for completeness.
- Verify ngrok URLs for callbacks.
- Debug API responses using print statements or logging.

- Repository: Refer to [CLICK HERE](https://github.com/Liladet/yagoutpay-dynamic-payment-method) for the latest code and examples.

This guide enables developers to set up and use YagoutPayâ€™s dynamic payment method with Python for secure and flexible payment processing.
